                    This Website does not follow the principles of C.R.A.P.

                    <li>
                        <strong>C - Constrast: </strong>
                        The elements of the site is all over the place. 
                        We have random things Highlighted and the 
                        contrast of white and random colored text does not help
                        with visiability
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>R - Repetition: </strong>
                        The Website has around 50 items on sale with adds 
                        mixed all mushed together which makes it hard to read.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>A - Alignment: </strong>
                        This sites has not Alignment. 
                        Everything is mix mashed resulting in elements to be overlaping and chaotic.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>P - Proximity: </strong>
                        There are so many items for sale in very close promixy where
                        it is hard to tell which price/item belongs to which image.

                <p class="centered">
                    This is a Good example of C.R.A.P.

                        <strong>C - Constrast: </strong>
                        The contrast for this website has a simple white
                        background with a Pink and blue theme with some 
                        darker gradients. It is full of animation and allows
                        certain things to popup
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>R - Repetition: </strong>
                        While there are some Repetition, it is kept to a minimal

                    <li>
                        <strong>A - Alignment: </strong>
                        The Alignment uses a lot of sections that prompts the 
                        user to scroll down the page.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>P - Proximity: </strong>
                        As you scroll down the page, it gets into some products they
                        sell which fits the overall theme of the website. The top menu 
                        is simple condensed down to 2 buttons on the left (Home and Shop All) and
                        thing related to checkout on the right.
